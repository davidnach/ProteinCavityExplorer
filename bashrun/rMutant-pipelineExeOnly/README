The directory contains several scripts along with several subdirectories with executables 
needed to perform rigidity analysis and generate a graph for a 4-alphanumeric ID 
corresponding to a protein that is fetched from the PDB.

script : cleanPipeline.sh
description : removes previously run files/programs
command line arguments : none
sample invocation : ./cleanPipeline.sh
output : none

script : invokePipeline_WT_allChains.sh
description : analyzes the rigidity of a single PDB file and all its chains; the PDB file is fetched from the PDB
command line arguments : 1 : a valid alphanumeric PDB ID
sample invocation : ./invokePipeline_WT_allChains.sh 1HHP

output : plain text files are output to several directories. The graph (nodes and edges) 
of the PDB file are output to the following for the sample invocation 1HHP : 
WT_RA/data/1HHP.all.ra.out/1HHP.all.processed.pdb/user/1HHP.all.processed.pdb_molFW.xml

script : invokePipeline_WT.sh
description : analyzes the rigidity of a single PDB file and all its chains that is fetched from the PDB
command line arguments : 2 : a valid alphanumeric PDB ID, and the chain to retain; write "all" to retain all chains
sample invocation : ./invokePipeline_WT_allChains.sh 1HHP A

output : plain text files are output to several directories. Most rigidity and PDB data is output to the following:
WT_RA/data/1HHP.A.ra.out/1HHP.A.processed.pdb/user
