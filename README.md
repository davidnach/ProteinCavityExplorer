# About
    This is a  web app used for exploring the properties of protein cavities. It was a developed with contribution of efforts from my senior project team at Western Washington University which includes: Daniel Fong, Seth Kvam, and Helaina Curtis.
    
    Since the website is only accessible inside of the WWU network at the moment i've attached a link with a demo video of the website. This is the first iteration of the web app and the app will be developed further by upcoming seniors at WWU.
